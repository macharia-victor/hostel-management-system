<h3>Rental Houses Concept Juja</h3>
<p>
   Most of these private hostels require students to make some booking payments which vary
from one hostel to the other. Some students prefer staying in residential houses to hostels. For
such students, JKUAT students and staff and any other person who want to stay in residential

houses around JKUAT have to move around and look for the apartments they would like to
rent. This is tiresome and it takes a lot of time to get the right place for renting.
Generally the current booking process in Juja, JKUAT affiliated hostels, private hostels and
residential houses is still being conducted when one shows up physically to these places.

<h3>Title 2</h3>
<p>
    The people and students in Juja should no longer suffer when identifying houses. This project
seeks help ease the process of identifying houses inside the town and its environs. It will also
provide a platform where people can book their houses, wherever they are. It will also help
landlords and care takers avoid the hustle of using paper based systems meaning that it will
also save office space used in storage of files.

<h3>Title 3</h3>
<p>
   The main problem that this project seeks to solve is the problem of identifying houses, which
as stated above can be quite a tedious process. Many students want houses near the school,
with the facilities that they need for example, continuous supply of water. Kamau, P. (2010).
It also seeks to help landlords who have problems advertising vacant houses. Once they can
advertise, then the students can view the houses online which helps both the landlord and the
students.
